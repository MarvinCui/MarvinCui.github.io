                    Today, I officially stepped down from AdventureX and changed my account status to "Resigned."
                    Unable to sleep at night, I decided to write something. Since I’ve left AdventureX, let me start
                    from how I ended up there step by step.

                    Looking back, it was a journey full of coincidences. What truly drove me forward were two key aspects:
                </p>
                <ol className="list-decimal list-inside text-purple-800 leading-relaxed text-lg sm:text-xl mb-6">
                    <li>A selfless attitude</li>
                    <li>A certain degree of "bravery"</li>
                </ol>
                <p className="text-purple-800 leading-relaxed text-lg sm:text-xl mb-6">
                    It all started with the @NewlearnerChannel on Telegram. I stumbled upon the group and saw the
                    early 0.x version of the Arc browser. Curious, I downloaded it and found it fascinating, so I wrote
                    an introduction article. Looking back, that article was really immature, but I’m grateful to
                    @newlearner365 for accepting it. You can find it <a href="https://t.me/NewlearnerChannel/10153" className="link-underline-nonemargin hover:text-gradient transition-all">here.</a>
                </p>
                <p className="text-purple-800 leading-relaxed text-lg sm:text-xl mb-6">
                    Over the next six months, I continued contributing to the channel, gradually evolving from
                    an immature writing style to something more refined.

                    In early December, the day after ChatGPT was launched, I was amazed when I first tried it. After
                    discussing it with n8r, we decided to create an AI-themed channel called @AIPulse_. There, I met
                    @Stv_Lynn, @linesoft_zyl, and @Yayoi_no_yume, and together, we built the channel step by step. If
                    I recall correctly, AI Pulse might have been the first AI weekly digest in the Chinese-speaking
                    internet community. With the help of NewlearnerChannel’s traffic, our subscriber count grew rapidly.
                </p>
                <p className="text-purple-800 leading-relaxed text-lg sm:text-xl mb-6">
                    We began submitting articles to platforms like @sspai_com and @utgd_net. Surprisingly, our first
                    review of Baidu’s ERNIE Bot not only made it to the front page of Sspai but was also widely shared.

                    With AI Pulse and Sspai articles under my belt, I happened to see FlowGPT’s hiring post on Twitter.
                    I submitted a resume on a whim and had my first interview while pacing around my family’s backyard.
                    I’m grateful FlowGPT gave me this opportunity, which, though short-lived due to a busy semester, left
                    a lasting impact on me.

                    After completing my schoolwork, I decided to take a gap year. During this period, I sought an internship
                    to stay productive. By chance, I came across @songe2016’s JD post on Jike and applied, which led me to
                    intern with Moonshot AI’s growth team. There, I learned a lot and formed many perspectives on AI.

                    Meanwhile, @Latticelin from Sspai invited me to join a "Youth Innovation Forum," which later transitioned
                    into @CreNeXT2024. Through CreNeXT, I learned about @adventurex_plan and began discussions on community
                    collaborations. At WWDC 24, I serendipitously met @ryanzhuuuu again. We talked all night about AdventureX,
                    and by morning, despite being sleep-deprived and on a motorbike ride, I impulsively declared, "I’m joining AdventureX!"
                </p>
                <p className="text-purple-800 leading-relaxed text-lg sm:text-xl mb-6">
                    The rest is AdventureX history. I met so many fascinating developers, participants, and guests, along
                    with an incredible AdventureX team.

                    AdventureX has its strengths and flaws. It’s still young and inexperienced, but seeing participants
                    collaborate, showcase their work, and improve their products assures me of its potential. It’s all about
                    letting more people experience the joy of creation.

                    As for myself, I’ll likely step back from this space, focusing on cognitive psychology and, hopefully,
                    finding a boyfriend and enjoying a meaningful relationship.

                    This concludes my journey with AdventureX. Onward to new beginnings!
